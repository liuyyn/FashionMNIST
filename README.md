# FashionMNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images. It consist of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated to with a label from 10 clothing classes. Zalando's Fashion-MNIST seeks to replace the original MNIST dataset for setting the standard machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and test datasets.

The original MNIST dataset has handwritten digits while Fashion-MNIST has differentiated clothing items from 10 different classes. This dataset is very popular among members of the AI/ML/Data Science community, and most members use it as a point of reference to support their algorithms.
